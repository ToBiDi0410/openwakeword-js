A high-performance, event-driven implementation of [OpenWakeWord](https://github.com/dscripka/openWakeWord) for the web and Node.js, built on **ONNX Runtime**.

This library allows you to run robust wake word detection (e.g., "Hey Jarvis") entirely client-side using WebAssembly, with a novel **Graph/Node Architecture** that handles backpressure, buffering, and state management efficiently.
